# SoloProStudio Social Knowledge & LP Ecosystem: Overview

SoloProStudio is a unified methodology for converting engineering insights into high-impact "Social Knowledge" (Articles & LPs) using a feedback-driven learning loop. 

## Core Philosophy: The 120% Vision Loop
We believe that infrastructure should be a "Butler" (providing silent, perfect service) rather than "Clutter" (noisily demanding attention). This is achieved through:
1. **Social Translation**: Turning code into relatable narratives.
2. **Radical Delegation**: Allowing AI the authority to operate at market speeds.
3. **High-Fidelity Aesthetics**: Using premium design to signal the value of the underlying technology.

## Artifact Navigation

### [Social Knowledge Framework](./social_knowledge_framework.md)
Guidelines for the "Ore" (俺) narrative persona and the SSD-based automation infrastructure (`notion_poster.js`, `promote_drafts.js`, `schedule_posts.js`).

### [Publish & Distribute Workflow](./workflows/publish_workflow.md)
Automation sequence for promoting drafts, smart scheduling for golden hours, and cloud deployment via GAS.

### [Project Case Studies](./case_studies.md)
Real-world examples tracking the evolution of ARTISTORY STUDIO, from automated server genesis to the deployment of the OpsOS Control Tower.

### [High-Conversion Design & Copywriting](./copywriting_and_design.md)
The technical and psychological standards for landing pages, including the PASTOR framework and HSL-based UI standards.
