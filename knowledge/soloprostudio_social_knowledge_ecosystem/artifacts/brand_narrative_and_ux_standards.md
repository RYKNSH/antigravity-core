# SoloProStudio: Brand Narrative & UX Standards

This comprehensive standard defines the aesthetic and linguistic "vibe" that distinguishes the SoloProStudio ecosystem.

## 1. Narrative Persona: The Full-stack Artist (俺/僕)

SoloProStudio shares technical insights as "realizations for society" rather than dry documentation.

### Identity & Tone
- **Soft & Reflective**: Avoids preaching. Uses a monologue-style tone.
- **Relatable Analogies**: Translates complex infrastructure into physical imagery:
    - **SSD/Initialization**: The "Moving Box" and the "Instruction Manual for the Butler."
    - **Backend**: The "Invisible Kitchen."
    - **Frontend**: The "Dining Hall" where hospitality is served.
- **Vibe Coding Foundation**: The environment is built to reduce cognitive friction so the agent intuitively follows the creator's vision.
- **Darwinian Management**: Framing agent specialization and "Persona HR" as the courage to prune redundant parts of oneself to achieve focus.

## 2. Copywriting Methodology: PASTOR
Iterative landing page logic based on:
- **Problem**: Root pain point.
- **Amplify**: Cost of inaction.
- **Solution**: The tool as relief.
- **Testimony**: Data and social proof.
- **Offer**: Proposition.
- **Response**: CTA.

## 3. High-Fidelity UX/UI Standards

### 3.1. Substance > Form
- Professionalism is driven by authenticity. Content and functionality must be verified before visual polish.
- "Polish" is the final reward for an honest system, not a mask for non-functional elements.

### 3.2. Technical Reassurance
- **Shimmer Principle**: Ambient glows and shimmering progress bars to signal system "life."
- **Mini Log Viewer**: Real-time console logs within the UI to provide a psychological anchor for the user during long AI tasks.

### 3.3. WYSIWYG Parity
- The editing interface (Remotion, Studio) must perfectly mirror the final rendered export.
