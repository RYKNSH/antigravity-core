# Metacognitive Patterns: Systems Transformation

This document abstracts the developer's high-level cognitive patterns observed in the Antigravity ecosystem.

## 1. Task-to-Pattern Abstraction
The developer rarely treats a task as a "one-off". There is a consistent drive to convert specific solutions into generalizable patterns.

*   **Pattern 1: Sidechannel Injection (Pattern 236)** - Derived from pydantic data preservation issues.
*   **Pattern 2: Proactive Suggestion Engine** - Derived from reducing decision fatigue.
*   **Pattern 3: /fbl (Feedback Loop)** - Derived from ensuring 120% quality autonomously.

## 2. Self-Evolution Loops
The developer utilizes the AI agent as a "Metacognitive Mirror". 

*   **Feedback Integration**: Sessions often end with a `/checkout` or `/evolve` to distill lessons.
*   **Prompt Engineering as Cognitive Offloading**: Building complex workflows (`/debate`, `/ship`) to automate decision-making processes.

## 3. Knowledge Item (KI) Obsession
Information is not considered "done" until it is archived as a Knowledge Item. 
*   This ensures that the "Agent and Human" memory is synchronized.
*   It protects against "Context Drift" in long-running projects.

## 4. Systems Thinking over Task Execution
The developer's primary value-add is not just writing code, but **designing the system that writes the code.** 
*   This shift from "Executor" to "Architect" is the defining trait of the current development phase.
