# Developer Behavioral Audit: 2026-02-06

> **Context**: User requested a self-audit using `/debate team`.
> **Participants**: Empathy Coach, Skeptic, The Architect.

## 📊 Summary of Findings

### ✨ Strengths (Long-term Assets)
1. **Intrinsic Motivation (内発的動機)**: Driven by the pure joy of creation and problem-solving. Operates on self-defined "120% Quality" standards rather than external KPIs.
2. **Systems Thinking (システム思考)**: Habitual tendency to abstract tasks into reusable workflows, patterns, and knowledge items.
3. **Metacognitive Ability (メタ認知)**: High capacity to observe own work patterns and build self-evolution mechanisms (e.g., `/evolve`).
4. **Output Velocity (高速アウトプット)**: Capable of running multiple complex projects in parallel with high execution speed.

### ⚠️ Weaknesses (Identified Risks)
1. **"Stop-less" Syndrome (止まれない傾向)**: Low awareness of energy management and rest. "Work-Life Integration" can lead to burnout if not monitored.
2. **Scope Creep & Diffusion (スコープ拡散)**: Tendency to spread across too many projects, potentially sacrificing depth for breadth.
3. **Mechanism Over-reliance (仕組み依存)**: Solving human/behavioral issues solely with "systems" or AI suggestions, sometimes avoiding direct self-transformation or behavioral change.
4. **Style Drift in Debugging**: Recurring issues in specific modules (e.g., telop rendering) suggesting a need for deeper structural fixes rather than repeated symptomatic patches.

## 🔄 Synthesis: The "Ryotaro" Archetype

The user is a **"Knowledge-Centric Systems Architect"** who gamifies development into a series of automated loops. 

| Dimension | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| **Motivation** | Joy-driven, aesthetic-driven |
| **Cognition** | Abstractive, pattern-seeking |
| **Action** | High-speed, multi-threaded |
| **Risk** | Energy depletion, "shallow" breadth |

## 📝 Recommendations for the AI Agent

1. **Energy Guardrails**: Proactively suggest breaks or session ends when detecting long-duration, high-intensity work.
2. **Depth over Breadth**: When scope expands too far, acting as a "Skeptic" to question the necessity of new sub-projects.
3. **Behavioral Mirroring**: Reflect the "mechanism over-reliance" back to the user to encourage deeper reflection when a system solution is just a band-aid.
